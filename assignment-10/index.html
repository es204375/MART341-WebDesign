                    Amazake is a traditional sweet, low-alcohol or non-alcoholic Japanese drink made from fermented rice. Amazake dates from the Kofun period. It is part of the 
                    family of traditional Japanese foods made using the koji mold Aspergillus oryzae, which also includes miso, soy sauce, and sake. It is often considered a 
                    hangover cure in Japan. By a popular recipe, koji is added to cooled whole grain rice causing enzymes to break down the carbohydrates into simpler unrefined sugars. As the mixture incubates, sweetness develops naturally.

                    Kombucha is a fermented, lightly carbonated, sweetened black tea drink commonly consumed for its purported health benefits. Juice, spices, fruit or other 
                    flavorings are often added. Kombucha is thought to have originated in China. Kombucha is produced by symbiotic fermentation of sugared tea using a symbiotic 
                    culture of bacteria and yeast SCOBY commonly called a mother. The microbial populations in a SCOBY vary.

                    Kumis is a fermented dairy product traditionally made from mare milk or donkey milk. The drink remains important to the peoples of the Central Asian steppes, 
                    of Turkic and Mongol origin. Kumis was historically consumed by the Khitans, Jurchens, Hungarians, and Han Chinese of North China as well. Kumis is a dairy 
                    product similar to kefir, but is produced from a liquid starter culture, in contrast to the solid kefir "grains".
