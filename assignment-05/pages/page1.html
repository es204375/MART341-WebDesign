        <h1>Cellular senescence</h1>

        <p>
            Cellular senescence is a phase in the life of most cells that occurs
            once a cell divides too many times. Senescent cells aid in growth,
            healing, and cancer prevention, but they also play a very large role
            in aging and aging related diseases. Longevity scientists are especially
            interested in senescence for this reason.
