            <p>The human oral microbiota is highly diverse and has a complex ecology, comprising bacteria, microeukaryotes, archaea and viruses. These communities have elaborate and highly structured biogeography that shapes metabolic exchange on a local scale and results from the diverse microenvironments present in the oral cavity. The oral microbiota also interfaces with the immune system of the human host and has an important role in not only the health of the oral cavity but also systemic health.</p>
