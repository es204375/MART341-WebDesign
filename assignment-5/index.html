            Human cells are not infintely divisible. We used to think they could go on dividing forever,
            but in 1961, an anatomist named Leonard Hayflick discovered something called the, "Hayflick limit,"
            which is the maximum number of times a normal somatic, differentiated human cell can divide before it
            enters a phase called, "cellular senescence." As far as scientists are aware, this limit does not
            apply to stem cells, which are not differentiated cells.
        </p>
        <p>
            A normal human cell will divide around 40-60 times before becoming senescent. This is because every
            time a cell divides, the telomeres on the end of each chromosome will shorten. Once these telomeres
            reach a critically small length, cell division stops and cells become senescent. The telomeres are
            kind of like protective caps on the end of DNA, so once they become criiticaly short, they are unable
            to protect the DNA from degradation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Scientists hypothesize that the state of cellular senescence is one of the body's methods of protecting
            itself from cancer. Once the telomere can no longer protect the DNA, the DNA is susceptible to degrading
            and mutating, which can result in cancer and other malfunctions. Senescent cells aren't all good though.

            One of the current leading theories on aging involves cellular senescence. When cells become senescent and
            stop dividing, they can accumulate in the body and releases inflammatory cytokines and other cellular signals
            that can contribute to bodily and cellular aging. Additionally, senescent cells drive aging by failing to
            function, and affected nearby non-senescent cells' ability to function.
