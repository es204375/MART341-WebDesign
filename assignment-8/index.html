            <h2>What is an Enderman?</h2>
            <p>
                Fans of the hit open-world indie game, &#34;Minecraft,&#34; surely know all about this lovably spooky creature. Standing tall and lanky, the <strong>Endermen</strong> have glowing purple eyes that match the floating particles
                that float around them. They teleport from place to place, occasionally picking up blocks and placing them elsewhere. An Enderman is a,  &#34;mob,&#34; a non-player created entity. Minecraft mobs are divided
                into three subsections, passive. neutral, and hostile. Hostile mobs will attack the player without first being hurt by the player, neutral mobs must be provoked into hurting the player, 
                and passive mobs will not become aggressive no matter what. Being classed as a neutral mob, Endermen won't attack the player unless specifically provoked. Spiders, another neutral monster, 
                also won't attack the player during the day unprovoked, but unlike Endermen, they will try to kill the player at night. <span id="game-tip">Endermen will only become
                aggressive towards the player when they've been attacked or when the player stares at their eyes for too long.</span> Another thing that sets them apart from their fellow mobs and monsters is that they are found
                in all three dimensions in the game (the End, the Nether, and the Overworld). These creatures have valuable loot. <span id="game-tip">When killed they drop an, "enderpearl," a strange round object that allows the player
                    to teleport wherever it lands after being thrown.</span> They've got twice as many health points as the player, and they can teleport out of the way of arrows making them
                a formidable foe! <span id="game-tip">However, Endermen are too big to get into spaces that are two blocks tall and they're hurt by water, so you can hide in a pond or a small cave.</span>
