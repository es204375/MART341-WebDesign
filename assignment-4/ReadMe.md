1. Browsers receive input from users (URLs, searches, links). Then, the browser sends a HTTP request to the web server that is hosting the desired web page. The server sends a HTTP response with the web page's content and metadata. Browsers interpret this data and render the web page.
2. The DOM is the Document Object Model, a programming interface for the web. It displays the web page in a way that allows programs to alter it dynamically.
3. HTML is a markup language for creating web pages. It has lax syntax rules, and is mainly for presenting content. XML is a more versatile markup language, mostly used for data interchange. It has stricter syntax rules. XHTML is HTML reformulated for XML. It combines both markup languages.
4. Most HTML pages need a declaration that defines the document type, an enclosing root element, a head which contains metadata, and the body which contains the web page content.
5. Index.html is the default landing page for websites, a starting point for users. For example, 'duckduckgo.com,' should lead to the index.html page.
6. Naming practices help maintain clarity. Files and folder names should contain no uppercase letters or spaces, names should be descriptive, and naming practices should be consistent. No, 'assignment-04,' if you've been naming all other assignments like, 'assignment-4.'
